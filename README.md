> Rusty old visualizations made for all platforms. Not just Windows ;)

Currently under development.

## Local Build

Build simply with cargo: `cargo run`. If you install the [cargo bundler](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle), you can also bundle the app by running `cargo bundle` (currently only tested on macOS).

## License

Currently none, but will change at some point, I guess.
